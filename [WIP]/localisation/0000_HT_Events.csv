EVTNAME410000;The Algaravian Movement;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC410000;The days of Andalusian glory are now but a distant memory. The Algaravian people have been toiling under the Moroccan yoke for centuries, and although the Atlantic ports have grown wealthy, the countryside is destituite and Africans still monopolize the highest spheres of political, economic and social power. Although Morocco has prevented outright contest by the northern Christian nations, it is clear that the Sultanate has entered a steep decline and won't be able to protect us much longer. We, the Algaravians, must take destiny into our own hands if we are to survive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA410000;Al-Andalus shall one day be free.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME410001;Trouble in Al-Andalus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC410001;The Pashalik Al-Andalus has been a Moroccan dependency for close to five centuries, ever since the intervention of the Sultanate in Iberia stopped the reconquista cold in its tracks. Since then, Al-Andalus has been the economic motor of Morocco and the Algaravian ports have become essential links in trans-Oceanic trade. This wealth is proving, however, to be a poisoned chalice as the nascent burgeois Algaravian class starts to embrace the ideals of nationalism and political societies begin to form, lobbying for Andalusian independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA410001;We can expect trouble in the coming years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME410002;The Algaravian Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC410002;The relation between Moroccans and Algaravians have grown increasingly strained in the past decades as the economic primacy shifted to the northern shores of the Mediterranean, yet political power remained in the limited circle of the Sultan's court. In a desperate attempt to revitalize the lethargic economy of the Moroccan coast, the government in Fez decreed a set of tariffs to be imposed on the more dynamic Algaravian ports. The decree was the spark needed to ignite the powder keg, and now the Pasha of Al-Andalus has declared independence and proclaimed the rebirth of the Emirate of Granada. The horrors of war will now be unleashed in the fair lands of Andalusia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA410002;The Algaravians will be crushed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME410003;Uprising in Ghránata;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC410003;The Pasha of Al-Andalus has been secretly purchasing arms from the northern Christian powers for years, biding his time when an opening might appear to throw off the Moroccan yoke once and for all. With the recent decree from Fez imposing tariffs on Andalusia, completely unacceptable even to the most war-shy of the Algaravian oligarchy, such an opening appeared - and the Pasha, not being a man to let opportunity go, has now declared from the Alhambra the refounding of the Emirate of Granada. Moroccan property is being seized and armies are being marshalled as it becomes clear that Andalusian independence will have to be won on the field of battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME410004;The Emirate Reborn;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC410004;The armies of the Pasha of Al-Andalus have against all odds beaten the Moroccan attempts to stamp out the revolution.

EVTDESC410005;The Revolution in the Pashalik of Al-Andalus has been utterly crushed, the Granadan armies routed and scattered to the countryside. Recognising that his bid for power had failed, the Pasha has surrendered in hopes of attaining some degree of amnesty for himself and the clique that supported him in the insurrection. The government in Fez will be implacable - Andalusia shall never rise again, and the old Pashalik system will be abolished in favour of direct rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC410006;The recent events in Andalusia have shown that our traditional enemies, the Algaravians and Moroccans, are weaker and most divided than ever. Opportunity is there to be seized, and the idea of a rebirth of the Reconquista spreads like wildfire through the political classes of the Christian states. A Congress is held in $CAPITAL$ to decide how to best act on the recent developments. A vocal but minoritary lobby argues for unification of the entire Iberian Peninsula under one single, powerful Christian state. Another faction refuses any sort of loss of sovereignity, and insists that Andalusia should be partitioned to avoid bloodshed between Christian brothers. A third group is formed by the military elites of the various states bordering the Algaravian muslims, who argue that only war can decide who deserves to take the spoils of the Moroccan decadence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME691000;The State of the Empire;x
EVTDESC691000;The old Incan state was the the unchallenged superpower of the South American Continent, however with the arrival of the foreigners things changed drastically. Even though earlier contacts were limited to trade and were mostly friendly in nature, the latter arrival of the French in the Northern Andes, followed by their rapid conquest of the Muisca resulted in a direct challenge towards the Incan Authority. This tensions would soon lead to border conflicts and escaltion into the First French-Incan War, which ended in a catastrophic and humiliating defeat for our Empire. However, leasons were learned from this war and a series of reforms were implemented. Furthermore the need to open to country to foreigners came appearent, leading to the establishment of multiple treaties between the Incan State and the Anglo-Norse - archenemy of the French. These reforms resulted in the transformation of the Incan Navy and soon lead to Incan emissaries to China, India and Europe. However, before the Era of Reform could have been completed, French troops invaded the lands of Kitu and with the inability to halt the invading forces, most of the Incan army was shattered and had to flee into the lands of Tumipampa -  ending the 2nd French-Incan War, this time ending in the lose of core territory. Despite this the people, loyal to the Sapa Inka kept fighting a brutal guerilla war, ultimativly resulting in the French Genocide of Kitu in 1833, transforming a once populous and prosperous region into a wasteland. The current emporer Waskar, humiliated and full of spite is eager for revenge and a second wave of reforms has started and intellectuals, aswell as highly decorated army comanders from China and the North Sea Empire were hired to help to reform the broken administration and army.;x
EVTDESC9900;The Timurid Empire, a state which has been declining for centuries has once again risen from their ashes, with the ascension of Kamran Mirza Shir to the throne in 1767. Already noticed as a smart and witty boy in his childhood, he had proven himself following the Timurid-Sayyid War in 1772, eventually leading to the sack, plunder and massacre of Delhi and the incorpartion of Kashmir and Punjab. While to the north the Argyns were defeated and pacified in the Battle of Turkestan in 1776 and in the west the Shiite Beghdilid dynasty was also finally subdued in 1784 and for the first time in centuries the empire once again reached to banks of the Upper Euphrates, while the Beghdilids themselves were reduced to a tributary. Besides his military genius, Shah Kamran Mirza Shir managed to reform large areas of the state and army. Nonetheless, he never was able to establish clear succession rules and with him now beeing an old and senile man, his inability to choose a successor and the increasing power of local rulers and tribes the Timurid Empire is seeming to head once again into chaos.;x

EVTDESC9901;Today the great Kamran Shah passed away in his sleep, without appointing a successor. His oldest son, Amir Qoli Khan, residing in Herat has managed to sway the royal court and officials in Herat and has proclaimed himself to be the new Shah of Iran and Turan. As the news of the death of Kamran Shah are spreading throughout the Empire, his other sons, the governours of Ajam - Abu Sa'id Mirza, Iraq - Soltan Ahmad ed-Din, Azerbaijan - Firuz Mirza and Mawarannahr - Salim Babur, respectivly, have proclaimed themselves as rightful successors.

EVTDESC606001;When the German Revolution engulfed Europe, Saxony's prized North Pleonian colonies were left adrift. With the Saxon Kingdom tied up in its fight with the revolutionaries and their opportunistic Nordic allies, Batavia was cut from contact with Europe and forced to fend for itself against no less than three Vinlandic invasions. The colonial landowners had no other choice but to adopt greater self-government in order to defend themselves, at least until contact could be reestablished with Saxony. In each of the Batavian colonies, councils of landowners took power and organised to fight off the Northmen. Meanwhile the mass of Batavian peons had begun to stir, inspired by events in Europe. Long oppressed by the Batavian landowners, the peons demanded an end to their bondage and land of their own to farm. A handful of forward thinking landowners, led by the charismatic Edwin Hoeber, promised them freedom in exchange for service in his army.;x
EVTDESC606002;His ranks swelled by tens of thousands of peons, Edwin Hoeber led the colonies to a series of smashing victories against Vinland. When the revolution ended, Hoeber and his allies expected to be richly rewarded by the Saxon crown, but instead found that the triumphant reactionary government in Dortmund was calling for their heads. The Saxon revanchists were not happy with Batavian concessions to the peons, or with colonial autonomy. War soon followed, waged between patriotic forces led by Hoeber and Saxon loyalists backed by the father country. In 1821, Saxony was forced to formally recognise the independence of the Batavian Republic. Since that day the progressive landowners have followed through with many of their promises, abolishing peonage in law and parcelling out the properties of traitor landlords. Yet today much remains unchanged in Batavia. Peonage still exists in practice in large parts of the country, and Batavian politics is still dominated by the landowning class.;x
