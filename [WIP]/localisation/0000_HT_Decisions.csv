The Empire has split apart many times, eventually though a system would develop where the Three Kingdoms - Denmark, Norway and Jorvik could operate relativly independently off of each other while still using the same treasury. Later consolidations of the Empire would result in further integrations of the Three Kingdoms. The estabilshment of the Komingstaor - an imperial parliment by Olaf the Wise in 18th century have paved the way for a new wave of integration reform ideas that are still alive an well in the Anglo-Norse Society. These ideas are represented by the liberal factions, calling for removal of all feudal remnaints and embracing a federal style of administration under the guidence of the king, their slogan is "Einn Kongur, Einn Kvnthri" - "One King, One Country".;x
