# Harald's triumph
 
- WORK IN PROGRESS - Still under Development and testing but also lacking devs to help work on the mod who aren't busy

- The mod focuses on a large amount of detail in each region with hundreds of new languages(cultures in base game but deemed too vague) and tags

- If you want to make a fork of HT or use a part of HT for your mod please ask Atlas primarily on discord "atlas35" or the HT discord: https://discord.gg/3Rmf9ZU8E3

- The folder labeled "[WIP]" is the official mod, HTL is meant to be a lighter version of the mod but has had less work and isn't official as noted with the lack of a .mod fill in the main folder.
